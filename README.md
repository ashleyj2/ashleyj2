Looking for a competent data analyst?

I graduated from ETSU in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in computing and a focus on Data analytics. I went on to complete an additional Data Analytics Masterschool program shortly afterwards in 2023. 

Besides my coding experience, I have a background in tutoring, which has given me a lot of insight and experience in data presentation.
