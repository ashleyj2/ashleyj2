I am currently working as a govenrment pricing data analyst. I graduated from ETSU in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Computing and a focus on Data Analytics. I went on to complete an additional Data Analytics Masterschool program shortly afterwards in 2023. 

Besides my coding experience, I have a background in tutoring Mathematics, which has given me a lot of insight and experience into explaining and presenting data.
